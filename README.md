This project may have some requeriments you need to meet in order to compile it. 
You may need NodeJS in order to run javascript on the console and install dependecnies. You can go to the NodeJS site and follow trough the installation process.  After you get the node command on the console, you will have the node package manager npm as well. Please read the package instruction section below.

## Installation:
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

In this homework assignment, your challenge is to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, you will also be ensuring that all unit tests pass. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

## Usage:
This is a command line application that uses an interface to prompt the user to enter information about a team.  The result is an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster, based on the user input.
